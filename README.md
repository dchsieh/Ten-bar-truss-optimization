# Ten-bar-truss-optimization
 main.m is the main program.
 add_element.m, compute_stress.m, and sol_TenBarTruss is the function to calculate the stress and deformation for the truss.
 obj.m and nonlcon.m is the function for fmincon to calculate optimize result.
 obj.m is the design function.
 nonlcon.m is the design constrain.
 nodes.mat is the dataset for nodes coordinate.
 element.mat is the dataset for element information including nodes, length, cross-section area, elastic modulus, sin value, cos value.
